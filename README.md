# AlgoProject

This is a simple JavaScript project for practicing writing different, common computer science algorithms, initially in JavaScript. Being a programmer isn't about rote memorization of how exactly to code data structures or algorithms but rather thinking through problems, researching best solutions and knowing which data structures or algorithms might best help solve the problem at hand.

A lot of these algorithm ideas came from [Algo Expert](https://www.algoexpert.io), but the solutions are mine, not using any of their code. If you're looking to learn I highly recommend their product though and it's rather inexpensive for what it provides.

## Installation & Usage

Simply clone the repository using github or a command line tool.

Then create a directory and change into it and run npm install

Example:

```
mkdir directory_name
cd directory_name
git clone https://github.com/Michael-Lafreniere/AlgoProject.git
npm install
```

You can comment out functions you're not interested in seeing run/results from.
